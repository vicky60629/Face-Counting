### Problem Statement

The method of face detection in pictures is complicated because of variability present across human faces such as pose, expression, position and orientation, skin colour, the presence of glasses or facial hair, differences in camera gain, lighting conditions, and image resolution.

Object detection is one of the computer technologies, which connected to the image processing and computer vision and it interacts with detecting instances of an object such as human faces, building, tree, car, etc. The primary aim of face detection algorithms is to determine whether there is any face in an image or not. We challenge all the hackers to participate in this computer vision challenge that aims to test skills in deep learning and object detection.

People detection and head counting is one of the classical albeit challenging computer vision application. For this problem, given a group selfie/photo, you are required to count the number of heads present in the picture.

### How to Use

Just follow 3 simple steps :

1. Download repository and extract using winrar in Downloads folder .<br>

2. Open Command Prompt and give command 'cd Downloads' . <br>

3. Then directory change to Downloads and then give command 'cd Face-Counting-master'  .<br>

4. Then directory change to "Face-Counting-master" and give command python app.py .Results comes as given below: <br><br>
